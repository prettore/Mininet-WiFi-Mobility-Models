**Pursue Mobility Model**
The Python implementation of the Pursue Mobility Model simulates a realistic node pursuit scenario in a 2D space. The model includes support for dynamic target movement, multiple pursuers, random environmental effects, and trace file generation for analysis or visualization. The implementation is extensible and configurable through a JSON file, allowing users to adapt the model to various scenarios. Some of the features included here are Dynamic Target Movement where the target moves using a Random Waypoint model and dynamically adjusts its path based on randomly generated waypoints, Realistic Pursuit Mechanics where Pursuers calculate directional vectors toward the target and move at variable speeds influenced by random environmental factors. Random deviations in direction simulate real-world conditions, Trace File Generation which logs all node movements to a trace file (.csv) for easy analysis or compatibility with visualization tools. It also includes Configurable Parameters with which we can  easily adjust target and pursuer behavior, acceleration factors, and randomization through a JSON configuration file (config_Pursue.json).
Animation helps to visualize the simulation using a dynamic matplotlib-based animation, showing node paths and real-time updates.
**Tactical Indoor Mobility Model (TIMM)**
TIMM provides an implementation of the Tactical Indoor Mobility Model (TIMM), which simulates realistic tactical movement of nodes (e.g., personnel or robots) within an indoor environment represented by a graph. Nodes dynamically move through the graph, accounting for constraints such as distance limits, pauses, and door-opening delays, while generating trace files and visualizations for analysis.
